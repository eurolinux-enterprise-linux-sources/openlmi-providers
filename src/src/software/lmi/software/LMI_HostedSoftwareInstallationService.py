    CIM_HostedService is an association between a Service and the System on
    which the functionality is located. The cardinality of this
    association is one-to-many. A System can host many Services. Services
    are weak with respect to their hosting System. Heuristic: A Service is
    hosted on the System where the LogicalDevices or SoftwareFeatures that
    implement the Service are located. The model does not represent
    Services hosted across multiple systems. The model is as an
    ApplicationSystem that acts as an aggregation point for Services that
    are each located on a single host.
