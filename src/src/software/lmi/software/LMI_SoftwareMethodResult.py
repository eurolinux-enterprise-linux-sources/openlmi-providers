    """Instrument the CIM class LMI_SoftwareMethodResult

    Jobs are sometimes used to represent extrinsic method invocations that
    execute for times longer than the length of time is reasonable to
    require a client to wait. The method executing continues beyond the
    method return to the client. The class provides the result of the
    execution of a Job that was itself started by the side-effect of this
    extrinsic method invocation.  The indication instances embedded an
    instance of this class shall be the same indications delivered to
    listening clients or recorded, all or in part, to logs. Basically,
    this approach is a corollary to the functionality provided by an
    instance of ListenerDestinationLog (as defined in the Interop Model).
    The latter provides a comprehensive, persistent mechanism for
    recording Job results, but is also more resource-intensive and
    requires supporting logging functionality. Both the extra resources
    and logging may not be available in all environments (for example,
    embedded environments). Therefore, this instance-based approach is
    also provided.  The MethodResult instances shall not exist after the
    associated ConcreteJob is deleted.
