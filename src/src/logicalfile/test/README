LogicalFile tests
=================
Basic tests for the LogicalFile provider. In the initial phase, a directory is
created and populated by various types of files (symlink, device file, fifo
file, ...). These are then used to test the provider.

As the LogicalFile provider explicitly implements all of its
associations-related methods, they should all be tested from both sides, meaning
that the respective associations should be called twice with both of their
"arguments".

Dependencies
------------
$ yum install python-pyudev

Usage
-----
The tests must be run on the same machine as the CIMOM!

Set following environment variables:
LMI_CIMOM_URL - URL to the CIMOM, e.g. 'https://localhost:5989'.
LMI_CIMOM_USERNAME - Name of the user on CIMOM the test will use, e.g. 'root'.
LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD - Password of the user, e.g. 'opensesame'.
LMI_LOGICALFILE_TESTDIR - Testing directory where all the files and testing will
                          take place. This directory must *not* exist on the
                          system and will be delete after the tests are
                          finished. Default is '/var/tmp/logicalfile-tests'.

Running the tests:
    LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD=opensesame \
    LMI_LOGICALFILE_TESTDIR="/home/user/my-testing-dir" \
    python test/test_basic.py
