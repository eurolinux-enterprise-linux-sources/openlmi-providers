Locale provider test
====================
Basic set of tests for Locale provider. It covers all methods
implemented in the provider (setting locale variables, setting
virtual console keyboard, setting x11 keyboard) and correctness
of all related property values compared to localectl command
output. The test also cleans up after itself and should restore
original values of all locale settings.

The test must be run as root (localectl requires root privileges for
non-read operations) on machine with CIMOM broker.

You can use localtest.sh for running the test - just update exported
variables there before you execute it.
