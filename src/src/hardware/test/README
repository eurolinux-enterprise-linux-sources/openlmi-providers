Testing
=======
Tests must be run as root on machine with cimom broker.

Dependencies
------------
 * python-hwdata

Preparation
-----------
``lmi.test`` module must be on python path. The easiest way to get it there is
to export ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable like this: ::

    export PYTHONPATH="${PATH_TO_GIT_ROOT}/src/python"

There is number of environment variables, which affect test running.
At least these four are required (with example values):

    export LMI_CIMOM_URL="https://localhost"
    export LMI_CIMOM_BROKER="tog-pegasus"
    export LMI_CIMOM_USERNAME="pegasus"
    export LMI_CIMOM_PASSWORD="pass"

Running tests
-------------
For example: ::
    nosetests -v ./TestHardware.py
