= Description =

The LMI_Journald provider exposes data stored in SystemD Journal service. See
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ for more information.

For the moment, global journal is used, all journal files are mixed together.
This may change in the future.

The CIM classes have been selected to be consistent with those used by
sblim-cmpi-syslog, for easy integration with existing tools. I haven't been able
to find a profile for CIM_LogRecord and CIM_MessageLog classes though.

There's a related DMTF profile DSP1010 "Record Log Profile" which may be subject
to extension of this provider.


== Limiting number of instances enumerated ==

Testing the provider showed up an issue with enumeration of LMI_JournalLogRecord
instances. On the testing machine there was 199583 journal records, which is simply
too much for the CIMOM, exceeding limits of memory and resulting reply.

An artificial limit has been set, currently to 1000 last records. This limit is
set by the JOURNAL_MAX_INSTANCES_NUM define in Journal.h source file. A solution
is being searched on how to deal with this issue in a nice way. For now take it
as a tail of the log.
