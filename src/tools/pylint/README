This tool uses pylint to check for errors in python code.
Before using it, please ensure, that you have installed openlmi-python
and all of the other cim provider packages, that you want to chek, into
your PYTHONPATH.

INSTALLATION TO PYTHON PATH
 * If checking already installed providers under /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/*
   you may skip this step.
 1. Choose some directory for your PYTHONPATH, if you don't have one yet. eg:
      $ mkdir ~/.python_sandbox
      $ export PYTHONPATH=~/.python_sandbox
    note: you may put the export line into you .profile
 2. Go to the directory of python egg, you want to install and install it:
      $ cd openlmi-providers/src/python
      $ python setup.py develop --install-dir=$PYTHONPATH
 3. Repeat step 2 for providers you want to check.
 4. Check sources.

FIX FOR PYLINT
 * Due to a bug in pylint's module handling, it fails to work with namespace
   packages. A bug is described here: http://www.logilab.org/ticket/8796
 * To fix this you may apply attached patch "logilab-modutils-0.57.1.patch"
   to logilab module (this one is for version 0.57.1):
     $ patch -d /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/logilab -p1 \
        <logilab-modutils-0.57.1.patch 

RUNNING PYLINTÂ CHECKER
 1. Add pylint directory to your PATH:
     $ cd openlmi-providers
     $ export PATH=`pwd`/tools/pylint:"$PATH"
 2. Use it
   * Run it on single module:
       $ cd src/software
       $ pylintlmi openlmi/software/LMI_SoftwarePackage.py
   * Run it on whole package:
       $ pylintlmi openlmi
