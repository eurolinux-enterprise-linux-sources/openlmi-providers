This directory contains MOF and registration files for openlmi-providers.
Registration files for c providers using KonkretCMPI are generated during
build time from MOFs.

Mof files are named according to this convetion:
  <NN>_LMI_<Profile>.mof

where <NN> is a string of two digits ensuring the correct order of
their parsing by cimom tools like sfcbrepos [1]. Some mof files depend
on others and thus need to be parsed after them.

Here is a convention for choosing the right number:
  05 - 10
        Qualifiers and other simple mofs without any dependencies on LMI or
        anything outside of cim-schema (05_LMI_Qualifiers.mof). These are
        shipped with openlmi-providers.
  20 - 40
        Mofs with base classes for our providers (30_LMI_Jobs.mof). Also
        shipped with openlmi-providers.
  50 - 80
        Mofs of our profiles shipped in their own package
        (60_LMI_Software.mof).

Mof files containing static indication filters[2] referencing other LMI
classes should have higher number than mof files containing them.
